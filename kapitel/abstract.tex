The goal of the present work is to answer whether the usage of artificial intelligence can lead to an increased resolution of a 3D smoke simulation. The following research question is asked: Is an upsampling of smoke simulations using artificial intelligence under the aspects of visual artefact-freedom, time efficiency and data reduction compared to simulation in high resolution possible?\\

An experiment was conducted which started by creating a data set of 3D simulations. A neural network was then set up and trained with the simulation data. To evaluate the results, the simulation data was reduced in resolution and then scaled up by the trainied artificial intelligence to the original resolution.\\

It was not possible to train an artificial intelligence in such a way that it could carry out the task without introducing visual artifacts. A comparison with other implementations showed that it is quite possible to upsample smoke simulation with further optimization of the neural network.\\
